## Seeding the Database

To populate the database with sample builder data, run the following command:

```
node scripts/seed-builders.js
```

This script will:
1. Connect to your MongoDB database using the URI specified in `.env.local`
2. Clear any existing builder data
3. Insert sample builder data
4. Display a success message when complete

## Frontend Integration

The builders data is integrated into two main pages:

1. **Builders List Page** (`/builders`): Displays all builders with search functionality and favorites support
2. **Builder Detail Page** (`/builders/[id]`): Displays detailed information about a selected builder, including projects, reviews, and contact information

Both pages include functionality for adding/removing builders from favorites and submitting reviews.
