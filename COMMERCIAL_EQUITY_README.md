## üí∞ Investment Logic

### Share Calculation
- Each property is divided into tradeable shares
- Share price = Total Property Value / Total Shares
- Minimum investment enforced per property
- Ownership % = (Shares Owned / Total Shares) √ó 100

### Returns Calculation
- **Monthly Rental** = (Monthly Property Rental √ó Ownership %) / 100
- **Capital Appreciation** = Investment √ó (1 + Appreciation Rate)^Years
- **Total Returns** = Rental Income + Capital Appreciation

### ROI Projections
- 1 Year ROI = (Annual Rental + Year 1 Appreciation) / Investment √ó 100
- Multi-year projections with compound appreciation
- Risk disclaimers and market condition warnings

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Authentication Integration
- Uses existing sessionStorage auth system
- Protected routes for investment actions
- KYC verification requirements
- Terms & conditions enforcement

### SPV Structure
- Each property mapped to Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
- Legal structure for fractional ownership
- Document management for ownership certificates
- Regulatory compliance notices

- **Hover Effects**: Property cards with shadow animations
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and spinners
- **Form Validation**: Real-time input validation with error messages
- **Modal Workflows**: Step-by-step investment process
